    "# Problem Statement: Fake News Classification\n",
    "Design and implement a machine learning model to classify news articles as either real or fake. The objective of this project is to build an accurate and robust classification system that can distinguish between genuine and fabricated news sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background:\n",
    "In the era of digital media, the spread of misinformation and fake news has become a significant challenge. False information can easily go viral and influence public opinion, leading to adverse consequences for society. To combat this issue, it is crucial to develop an automated system that can identify and flag potential fake news articles, helping users make informed decisions about the information they consume.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset:\n",
    "We'll be using a dataset containing a collection of news articles from various sources. Each article will be tagged as either \"real\" or \"fake\" to serve as the ground truth for training the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Flow:\n",
    "1. Data Gathering. \n",
    "2. Data Preprocessing:\n",
    "   A. Tokenization\n",
    "   B. Lower Case\n",
    "   C. Stopwords\n",
